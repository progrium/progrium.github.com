  <h1><a href="/blog/2012/09/07/let-me-tell-you-about-my-website">Let me tell you about my website</a></h1>
  <p>Since mid-July I&#8217;ve been on vacation traveling around the world. Originally, the only project I allowed myself to work on is my website and blog. I quickly broke that rule with a number of new and existing projects. Nevertheless, as you can see, I did ship this site.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never been happy with my website or blog, perhaps because I&#8217;ve never been able to invest enough time into it. Over the years, I&#8217;ve at least been able to put a lot of thought into what I want and how I want to express myself. This attempt gets pretty close.</p>

<h3 id='highlevel_goals'>High-level Goals</h3>

<p>Too many of my personal site designs have been dark and gloomy, often monochromatic. I think one of the biggest ideas going into this project was to make something bright and colorful. From a pure functional standpoint, I felt this was important. I also wanted to actually reflect my style. Too often I&#8217;ve settled for pre-designed blog themes that &#8220;kinda, sorta&#8221; match my sense of style and how I want to express myself. This time I would have full control.</p>

<p>As I&#8217;m starting to freelance again, I also wanted to have a good marketing tool for myself. Even if it just expressed the affordances I have as a free agent. If somebody discovered me online, they&#8217;d know they could buy my time. &#8220;Yes, I can be hired for any of these fine services.&#8221;</p>

<p>Combining my personal website with my blog is another thing I wanted to do. So far they&#8217;ve always been separate. Not only would this be for consistency and simplicity, but for future proofing. Anything else I want to put online I can do with this site in a way that feels part of a whole. A whole that represents my identity and personal brand.</p>

<h3 id='aesthetic'>Aesthetic</h3>

<p>Like I mentioned, I wanted bright and colorful. I also wanted simple and toy-like. I wanted it to feel well designed, but without a lot of modern web design tropes. This led to a minimalist foundation that I could sprinkle my favorite motifs on top of.</p>

<p>I actually only had one website in mind that I used for initial inspiration. In fact, I think when I came across <a href='http://disqus.com/for-websites/awesome-ux'>this page of the Disqus website</a>, I immediately started imagining a new personal website. Most of that initial vision has since disappeared, but with that framing I was able to move on to colors.</p>

<p>The colors on that page reminded me of one of my favorite kinds of infographics: transit maps. I quickly started poking around ColourLovers for palettes inspired by transit maps. I found a few and settled on <a href='http://www.colourlovers.com/palette/1043750/Tokyo_Subway'>one based on Tokyo&#8217;s subway map</a>. Then I moved on to typeface.</p>

<p>I limited my options to what was available on Google Webfonts. Previously I was a fan of the Droid Sans and Droid Serif families. This time around, I used Open Sans as the primary font. For the header title (my name), I needed something different. I wanted something heavier but not wide. Ideally, I wanted a bold Futura Condensed, but a heavy Futura isn&#8217;t on Google Webfonts.</p>

<p>I struggled with this for a while, then by accident found VT323. It had the weight and shape qualities I was looking for, but I didn&#8217;t think I wanted a pixelated typeface. It seemed too cliche. However, when I tried it, it became obvious VT323 not only went well with my pixelated avatar, but it added more of me to the overall design without being too cliche.</p>

<p>The tree in the header was a late addition. I have a thing for trees as a symbol of nature and I wanted to add more character to the design. Originally I was going to use Context Free to create a procedurally generated tree, but this proved too time consuming to get what I wanted. A free vector based tree was not hard to find.</p>

<h3 id='platform'>Platform</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve become a fan of using <a href='http://pages.github.com/'>GitHub Pages</a> for simple websites. It&#8217;s hosted, it&#8217;s free, and powered by Git. The site is then versioned, editable online, and even forkable. The only limitation is that it only hosts static files.</p>

<p>Luckily, they&#8217;ve built-in support for <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>, which is more or less like pre-rendering a dynamic site. This not only gives you templating, layouts, and includes, but it&#8217;s &#8220;blog aware&#8221; so you get pagination, meta-data, and even related post links. The only real dynamic bits of the site are blog comments and analytics, both are solved by client-side JavaScript powered services. Neither of those I care to have in my Git repo anyway.</p>

<p>The other part of this plan I like is that it lets you write content in simple Markdown files kept in a Git repo. If I ever need, I can take this repo anywhere and still have my blog posts as Markdown files. This is a far more ideal place to be in that most blogging platforms I&#8217;ve used in the past.</p>

<h3 id='future'>Future</h3>

<p>It&#8217;s still a work in progress. You may have noticed the homepage currently redirects to the blog index. I&#8217;m hoping to have more of a landing or intro page as the homepage. The idea there is to quickly communicate what I&#8217;m about and what I work on.</p>

<p>I also want to incorporate more hand-drawn elements into the design. A lot of my writing is well accompanied by diagrams and visuals, so I wanted to include more of these in my posts. Doing as many of these as I can with my drawing tablet will give the site more character. My character.</p>

<p>I was also thinking about &#8220;project pages&#8221; that describe and introduce the projects I&#8217;m involved in without being hidden as an old blog post. Perhaps more exciting, though, are project idea pages or &#8220;blueprints&#8221;. These would allow me to document projects I&#8217;m thinking about building, letting me get feedback and encourage collaboration before even starting.</p>

<p>Building a site from scratch was a pretty substantial investment. With the right tools and enough time to think through and iterate on the visual design, I now have something that works and that I can build on as needed. Not only that, I shipped before I got back from vacation. :)</p>
